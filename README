tiny.TypeBox
- Find the right font for any website. _Now even easier!_

This is a bookmarklet.

It can also be included statically on a page by putting this in the header:
<script src="http://tiny.typebox.info/tiny.typebox.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
and this in the body:
<div id="tinytypebox"></div>

More info on http://tiny.typebox.info (perhaps).
